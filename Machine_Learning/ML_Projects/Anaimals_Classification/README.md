Using Data Visualizations to make wiser decisions which could land the Business to make bigger profits and understand the root cause and behavioral analysis of people and customers associated to it. In this Repository I have deeply discussed about Line Plots, Bar plots, Scatter Plots, and Pie Charts, Apart from that I have Discussed scientific plots, 3d plots, animated plots, interactive plots to visualize any kind of business problem and that too of any complexity.

Data Visualizations using Python Data Visualization Library is the easiest way to perform Data Visualizations, and with the use of Dash, we can also, build up Dynamic and Interactive Live Dashboards without the help of Front end or backend javascript.

In this Tutorial, I have discussed all the Important and prominent Charts and their variations so that anybody can understand it easily. I have covered Matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly, Plotly-express, bubbly, ipywidgets. All the Tutorials are built upon JUpyter Notebooks, and the Datasets used for these Notebooks are already uploaded in a folder named **Datasets**.
